# KMeans Clustering with Silhouette Coefficient

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates KMeans clustering on a synthetic dataset using various performance metrics such as the Elbow method and Silhouette coefficient analysis. The goal is to evaluate the optimal number of clusters based on the elbow plot and silhouette scores and visualize the clustering results.

## Requirements

The script requires the following libraries to be installed:

-numpy
-matplotlib
-sklearn

**Description**

The script performs the following key tasks:

1. **Generate Synthetic Data**  
   Data is generated using the `make_blobs()` function from `sklearn.datasets`. This data contains 500 samples, 2 features, and 4 centers (clusters).

2. **Elbow Method for Determining Optimal Clusters**  
   A KMeans model is fitted to the dataset for cluster values ranging from 1 to 10.  
   The "Within-Cluster Sum of Squares" (WCSS) is calculated for each value of `k` and plotted to create an elbow plot, helping to identify the optimal number of clusters.

3. **KMeans Clustering**  
   A KMeans model is trained with 4 clusters as a selected example, and the predicted cluster labels are printed.

4. **Silhouette Analysis**  
   Silhouette coefficient analysis is performed for a range of cluster sizes (from 2 to 6).  
   The silhouette coefficient measures the density and separation of clusters, providing a metric to evaluate the clustering quality.  
   Silhouette scores are computed for each sample and visualized using silhouette plots.

5. **Visualization**  
   Two types of visualizations are provided for each value of `k` in the silhouette analysis:
   - **Silhouette Plot**: Shows the silhouette coefficient for each sample within the clusters.
   - **Cluster Plot**: Visualizes the actual clusters with different colors, with markers at the cluster centers.
